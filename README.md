Name: Elinor Rotenberg-Aravena
Project: Multi-Page Portfolio (Paradigm Shift Recreation)

What I Built:
I created a four-page responsive website (Home, About, Gallery, and Contact) using semantic HTML5 and custom CSS3. The design features a split-screen layout on the Home page, an alternating content layout on the About page, and a responsive grid for the Gallery.

How I used ChatGPT:

Planning: I used ChatGPT to break down the target design into a structured plan, identifying shared components like the header and footer.

Structuring: I prompted ChatGPT to generate the HTML skeleton for each page one by one to ensure consistent class naming and file linking.

Styling: I requested the CSS in layers, starting with a global reset and typography, then moving into specific layouts like the Flexbox "split" view and the CSS Grid for the gallery.

Responsiveness: I used ChatGPT to help write media queries that stack the sidebar and columns for mobile users.

Manual Changes:

I manually updated the image src paths to match the filenames in my images/ folder.

I adjusted the "accent color" (Hex: #1cb495) to match the specific green used in the target design.

I verified all internal links between index.html, about.html, gallery.html, and contact.html were working correctly.
